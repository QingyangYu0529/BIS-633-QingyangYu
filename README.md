## Question 2

### Data processing

1)All codes written in python. Code files are .ipynv format.

First I imported library pandas to load dataset "BRFSS_19_data.csv".

2)Then I checked the [LLCP 2019 Codebook Report document of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2019/pdf/codebook19_llcp-v2-508.HTML). I found that the FIPS code of state Connecticut is 09. I filtered the data to include only respondents in the state of Connecticut, the result was saved into the list data_CT.

3)According to the [LLCP 2019 Codebook Report document of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2019/pdf/codebook19_llcp-v2-508.HTML), I found that the variable 'EXRACT11' refers to the type of physical activity reported by respondents. I selected 'Jogging' among the exercise activities listed for variable EXRACT11, which is represented by value 28.

So I filtered the data in which the value of column 'EXRACT11' is 28, in order to select all the people that spend the most time to jog. The result was saved into the list data_jogging.

According to the [LLCP 2019 Codebook Report document of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2019/pdf/codebook19_llcp-v2-508.HTML), I found that variable '_SEX' refers to the sex of each respondent: value 1 refers to male, and value 2 refers to female. 

Then I used groupby to group all the people that favourite jogging by gender, the result was saved into the list data_jogging_by_sex.

<img src="https://github.com/QingyangYu0529/BIS-633-QingyangYu/blob/main/Figures-in-running-result/data_jogging_by_sex.jpg" style="zoom:120%;" />

> According to the running result, number of male respondents who selected the activity 'Jogging' is 1439. While number of female respondents who selected the activity 'Jogging' is 832.


### Bonus Question

According to the [LLCP 2019 Codebook Report document of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2019/pdf/codebook19_llcp-v2-508.HTML), I found that variable 'HTIN4' refers to the reported height in inches.

Noted that there are two circumstances:
If the value of HTIN4 is 36-95, the unit of reported height is (inches).

If the value of HTIN4 is BLANK('NaN'), respondent do not know/refused/was not asked to answer about their heights, or the reported height is missing.

First, I removed all the 'NaN' from dataframe data_CT, the result was saved into the list data_CT_height. 

Then I extracted the column 'HTIN4', the result was saved into the list data_CT_height.

<img src="https://github.com/QingyangYu0529/BIS-633-QingyangYu/blob/main/Figures-in-running-result/data_CT_height.jpg" style="zoom:120%;" />

To get the average height of people living in Connecticut, I calculated the average height(unit: inch), then transferred the unit into meters, and printed the result.
